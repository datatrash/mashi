# MASHI

A 100% no-std compatible Rust implementation of a [PAQ](http://mattmahoney.net/dc) style arithmetic coding, context mixing compressor. Its intended use case is compressing 64k demos, but whatever works for you!

### License
Since the original PAQ compressors are GPL licensed be aware that Mashi is also GPL licensed.
